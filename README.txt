Twindy
=======

I want to dabble in a git-backed website... so I'm going to create a CMS type site which will power my personal blog.

Some things I hope to achieve with this project:
 -  Build a website in a lighter Ruby web framework, like Sinatra.
	- (Perhaps even dabble in a different language/framework, like Python/Django)
 -  Use git as a datastore, to provide great data portability.
 -  Leverage git features, like branching, to create new "pages" or "sub-sites"
 -  Gain a better understanding of git and the libraries associated with it..
 -  Gain a better understanding of TDD/BDD.
   -  I will try to be very strict about TDD. No code without pre-existing tests!
 
What is outside the scope of my project:
 -  Not worried about scalability. Hopefully it scales well, but it will be used in a personal project
   -  I will not worry about agressive caching, automated compression of the git object database, etc.
 -  Will not prioritize making the project easy to deplpoy
   - Ideally I can just install this on multiple sites; but the installer script may not be a first priority.

Why "Twindy"?
 - NO IDEA! I came up with the project while walking to class, and it was very windy outside?
 - I guess "T'was Windy" comes to mind.
